Abstract
With economic demands soaring, population growth rising, and urban sprawl expanding, humans are becoming more exposed and aware to environmental disasters (natural and non-natural) and are seeing the affects these are disasters are having on the Earth climate. The purpose of this research project is to analyse the correlation between the number of environmental disasters and the impact this is having on global temperatures over the last 44 years (1979-2023). Furthermore, these variables will be intentionally scrutinized to identify any significant trends and/or correlations to see if they are statistically significant or not. 

Introduction
With the Earth spinning on its axis, rotating and in constant orbit, environmental disasters are largely uncontrollable. The Earth’s landmass constitutes 29% of the total surface area and the remaining 71% is consumed by large bodies of ocean water. Over the last 44 years (1979-2023), the needs of human society are exponentially growing and changing, which is causing urban sprawl to expand in geographical parts of the world. This in essence is increasing the likelihood of humans experiencing environmental phenomena (natural and non-natural). 

Throughout this analysis, data has been collected from the “EM-DAT: The International Disaster Database”, to collect raw data for the total number of recorded data entries from the previous 44 years (1979-2023). This centralized database collects and stores data for all international disasters since the early 1900’s, and provides a plethora of data (disaster type, region, city etc.) which was compiled and transformed into a csv.file for analysis. In amalgamation to this, the “GISS Database – NASA”, was also applied to this csv.file to fill any missing Latitude and Longitude points for each city where the disaster occurred. After this data was combined, the “Open Weather Maps API”, was implemented to combine historical temperature data over the last 44 years (1979-2023), to review any trends and/ or correlations between these two variables. 

Furthermore, the following questions will be dissected with a Jupyter Notebook:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)	What is the influence of geographic coordinates on the frequency of natural disasters? Compare the Northern Hemisphere Vs. Southern Hemisphere.

(2)	What is the correlation between natural disaster frequency and average temperatures over time?

(3)	What category of natural disaster is more likely to occur during specific seasons?

(4)	Are there global hotspots for specific disaster categories?

(5)	Are there any noticeable trends in different types of natural disasters over time?

(6)	Which countries might be the ‘safest’ from, or most ‘at risk’ of natural disasters? (BONUS)
